      "text": "The biggest arbitrage in lead gen right now isn't cold email or cold calling.\n\nIt's WhatsApp.\n\n2B+ people use it daily.\n\nAnd almost nobody in the agency worldis paying attention.\n\n2 billion people use it every single day.\n\nNot as a \"nice-to-have.\"\n\nAs THE way they do business.\n\nIn Dubai, your dentist confirms appointments on WhatsApp.\nIn São Paulo, your lawyer sends contracts on WhatsApp.\nIn London, your estate agent closes deals on WhatsApp.\n\nAnd in the US…\n\nWe're still sending \"Just checking in!\" emails\nthat get opened by exactly... nobody.\n\nLet's look at the numbers for a second:\n\nCold email open rate: 22%\nSMS open rate: 45%\nWhatsApp open rate: 98%\n\nNinety. Eight. Percent.\n\nAnd yet most agencies are over here\nA/B testing email subject lines\nlike that's going to close a 76-point gap.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting though.\n\nWhatsApp Business API now supports\nrich media, automation, and full CRM integration.\n\nPair that with Voice AI and things get wild:\n\n→ AI agents call back within 60 seconds of a WhatsApp inquiry\n→ They run 24/7 across every time zone\n→ No sick days. No hold music. No \"let me transfer you.\"\n\nMIT research says responding within 5 minutes\nmakes you 100x more likely to convert.\n\nWe're talking 60 seconds.\n\nNo call center on earth can staff that.\n\nWhen your agency can deliver this to clients,\nyou're not just adding another service.\n\nYou're entering markets where WhatsApp\nisn't optional but DEFAULT.\n\nEurope. Middle East. LATAM. Southeast Asia.\n\nThat's not a feature add.\nThat's an entire continent of pipeline\nmost agencies don't even know exists.\n\nThe cool thing is this is exactly what we built Wave Runner for.\n\nNative WhatsApp integration.\nRealistic Voice AI.\nNative CRM Integrations with GHL & Hubspot.\nNative workflow builder.\nWhite-label ready.\n\nAll in one place.\n\nIf you run an agency or BPO\nand haven't explored WhatsApp + Voice AI yet\n\nyou're not behind the curve.\n\nYou're on a different road entirely.\n\nDrop a 🌍 if you want me to break down\nexactly how the system works.",

      "text": "I made the YC application GUIDE I wish I’d had when I was applying 🔥\nYC accepts ~1.5% of founders - most applications fail for the same reasons:\n\nAfter reviewing 100+ YC applications, I kept seeing the same mistakes - even from strong founders with good ideas.\n\nIt took me 3 tries to get into Y Combinator with Fluently: AI English tutor, GetFluently.app (YC W24) because I made those mistakes myself. That's why I decided to put together a guide to help founders apply the right way from the start.\n\nWhat’s inside:\n- How to answer YC questions\n- Real examples from successful applications\n- The most common mistakes that quietly kill applications\n- How to show progress, traction, and founder-market fit (even if you’re early)\n\nThis guide is based on my personal experience and was reviewed by other YC alumni and partners. So check it out before applying!\n\n--\n📌 Save this & send it to a founder who’s preparing their YC application",

      "text": "I spent 50+ hours building apps with AI.\n\nThis 5-step framework saved me from wasting 90% of that time:\n\nMost people jump into AI tools and start prompting randomly.\n\nNo plan. No structure. No idea what \"done\" looks like.\n\nThat's why 80% of AI projects stall after day one.\n\nI built the BLAST framework to fix that.\n\nIt works for any AI coding tool. Any project. Any skill level.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nB → Blueprint your outcome before you touch a tool\nL → Link your integrations (APIs, databases, services)\nA → Architect the plan (let AI map it, you approve it)\nS → Style the experience (UI, brand, user flow)\nT → Trigger the execution (schedule it, ship it, automate it)\n\nI've used this to build 12 live applications.\n\n3 of them generate revenue on autopilot.\n\nThe difference between people who build cool demos and people who ship real products?\n\nA system. Not motivation.\n\nI turned BLAST into a free one-pager you can use on every project.\n\nComment \"BLAST\" and I'll send it over.",

      "text": "Anthropic just shipped Agent Teams into Claude Code and I put together a complete guide on how to install and use them.\n\nThe OpenClaw community was already doing this with custom skills and workarounds....\n\nAnthropic noticed and made it native.\n\nNo plugins or setup hacks needed.\n\nIt's built right into the tool now.\n\nInstead of one agent doing everything solo in a straight line, a lead agent now breaks your task into pieces, spins up multiple teammates, and they all work on different parts of your project at the same time.\n\nOne researches, one debugs, one builds.\n\nThey talk to each other, share findings, and coordinate through a shared task list without you having to manage any of it.\n\nThe guide covers:\n→ What agent teams are and how they actually work\n→ How they're different from sub-agents (and when to use which)\n→ How to enable them in your settings in 30 seconds\n→ How to start your first team and what to say\n→ Best practices so you don't burn through tokens\n→ The limitations you need to know before you start\n\nThis is one of those features that sounds small on paper but completely changes how you work with Claude Code once you start using it.\n\n1️⃣ Connect with me\n2️⃣ Comment \"AGENT\" and I'll send you the complete guide to your inbox",
